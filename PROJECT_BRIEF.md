# PROJECT BRIEF - Wagtail CMS: Real Functionality & Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document addresses the reality of the current Wagtail CMS implementation versus the documented "EXTRAORDINARY" features. This brief provides an honest assessment of what works, what doesn't, and what needs to be addressed for a coherent, functional system.

## Current State Analysis

### ❌ Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Documentation vs. Reality Gap
- **Issue**: Existing `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` present an idealized view
- **Reality**: 40 tests exist, but 9 fail and 11 have errors
- **Impact**: Development team working with unreliable foundation

#### 2. Test Infrastructure Problems
- **Issue**: Tests written incorrectly (trying to instantiate mixins directly)
- **Reality**: `DesignMixin()` cannot be instantiated alone - it's meant for inheritance
- **Impact**: Cannot verify if features actually work

#### 3. Functionality Coherence Issues
- **Issue**: Streamfield blocks claim to have design system integration
- **Reality**: CSS class generation returns empty strings, choice fields not accessible
- **Impact**: UI/UX features documented but non-functional

### ✅ What Actually Works

1. **Basic Django/Wagtail Setup**: Application runs without critical errors
2. **Database Models**: Order, Product, Blog systems functional
3. **Theme Structure**: CSS files and static assets properly organized
4. **Basic Streamfields**: Core Wagtail streamfield functionality intact

## Required Functionality (Based on Real Needs)

### 1. Core E-commerce Features
- **Orders System**: ✅ Working - models, views, checkout process functional
- **Product Management**: ✅ Working - product pages, categories, pricing
- **Cart Functionality**: ✅ Working - add to cart, shipping calculations
- **Payment Integration**: ✅ Working - Stripe integration present

### 2. Content Management 
- **Blog System**: ✅ Working - pages, categories, pagination implemented
- **Streamfields**: ⚠️ Partially working - basic functionality exists, enhanced features broken
- **Media Management**: ✅ Working - image uploads, document handling

### 3. Design System (Realistic Assessment)
- **CSS Framework**: ✅ Present - Tailwind-based styles exist
- **Component Classes**: ❌ Broken - documented classes don't work as intended
- **Theme Support**: ⚠️ Limited - basic structure exists, dynamic theming incomplete

## Error Handling Requirements

### Current Error Handling
- **500 Error Page**: ✅ Basic template exists
- **Form Validation**: ✅ Django forms handle basic validation
- **Order Processing**: ✅ Try-catch blocks in checkout process

### Missing Error Handling
- **Streamfield Validation**: ❌ Enhanced validation not working
- **Design System Fallbacks**: ❌ No fallback when CSS classes fail
- **User Feedback**: ⚠️ Limited user-facing error messages

## UI/UX Coherence Issues

### Problems Identified
1. **Inconsistent Naming**: Mix of French and English throughout interface
2. **Missing Feedback**: Limited user feedback for actions
3. **Responsive Design**: Claims of responsive images not fully implemented
4. **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and accessibility features documented but not tested

### Required Standards
1. **Language Consistency**: Choose French OR English, not both
2. **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages for all user actions
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure basic functionality works without JavaScript
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance for public-facing features

## Things Forgotten/Duplicated/Badly Implemented

### Forgotten Features
1. **Error Templates**: Only 500.html exists, missing 404, 403, etc.
2. **Form Validation Messages**: Many forms lack proper user feedback
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design incomplete
4. **Performance**: No caching, optimization, or monitoring

### Duplicated Work
1. **Block Definitions**: Similar list blocks repeated across modules
2. **CSS Classes**: Multiple definition patterns for same functionality
3. **Validation Logic**: Similar validation repeated in different places

### Badly Implemented
1. **Test Suite**: Tests don't match actual usage patterns
2. **Mixin Architecture**: Mixins cannot be tested in isolation
3. **CSS Generation**: Returns empty strings instead of working classes
4. **Documentation**: Claims features work that don't exist

## Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Functionality (This PR)
- [ ] Fix failing tests to match actual implementation patterns
- [ ] Ensure CSS class generation works for basic use cases
- [ ] Add proper error handling for streamfield blocks
- [ ] Create realistic documentation

### Phase 2: UI/UX Coherence 
- [ ] Standardize language (French vs English)
- [ ] Add proper error templates (404, 403, etc.)
- [ ] Implement consistent form validation feedback
- [ ] Fix responsive design issues

### Phase 3: Performance & Reliability
- [ ] Add caching for expensive operations
- [ ] Implement proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add proper deployment configuration

## Testing Strategy (Realistic)

### Current Testing Problems
- Tests instantiate mixins directly (impossible)
- Tests expect functionality that doesn't exist
- No integration tests for actual user workflows

### Proposed Testing Approach
1. **Unit Tests**: Test actual block classes, not mixins in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test complete user workflows (add to cart, checkout, etc.)
3. **Functional Tests**: Test UI components with actual rendered HTML
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure pages load within acceptable time limits

## Success Metrics

### Short Term (1 month)
- [ ] 100% of existing tests pass
- [ ] All documented features actually work
- [ ] Error handling provides clear user feedback
- [ ] Basic responsive design works on mobile

### Medium Term (3 months)
- [ ] Complete UI/UX coherence (consistent language, design)
- [ ] Performance optimization (page load < 2 seconds)
- [ ] Accessibility compliance for public features
- [ ] Proper deployment and monitoring

### Long Term (6 months)
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] Full design system implementation
- [ ] Multi-language support if needed
- [ ] Advanced features (search, filtering, recommendations)

## Conclusion

This brief provides an honest assessment of the current state and realistic requirements for moving forward. The focus is on fixing what exists rather than implementing new "extraordinary" features that may not be properly tested or maintained.

**The goal is not perfection, but functionality, coherence, and reliability.**
